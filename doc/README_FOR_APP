Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.

== Architecture
This file is for development doc, /README is for users documentation.
please update CHANGELOG to state any new functionality or amend on existing functionality.

All files named application are meant for things that applies and make sense application wide.
Use then application_layout to refer to anything that should apply only to the layout and not to the templete, despite things written in there may apply to templates as well.
E.g.: br_tag is defined in application_helper.rb because it is meant to be used all along the app, au contraire flash_messages belongs to application_layout because despite the method is available in templates as well, it makes sense only in the layout.

Evaluate RESTFUL architecture, use HTTP verbs correctly.

Use css_content, Use js_content, title_content to customize the outside of the template

Class_extension contains all ruby/rails class/module extensions, read it!

TestsController has been made as a sandbox, never leave important things over there.

On top of each file there is the file documentation, valid for extensions:
rb, yml, js, css, (html)

Use gtg to commit your job, use significant comments and group them by task.
Use different a different branch for each functionality. 

== Comments
Gemfile: put useful comments inline, like commands to run
Comment every new methos or function, no particular formatting
Don't forget to state a meaningful example with e.g.:

== Code conventions
Composed words can be considered one, e.g.: datepicker and not date_picker
Use correct conventions for each languate, e.g.: #log-links for css, but the ruby fucntion has to be log_links

Don't use parentesis for methods, but only in simple statements, use parentesis in doubt.


== Css and html
Name all the stylesheets in css.scss and include them in application.css.scss
Use html5 tags where applicable, avoid tables
Links to external sites must open in a different tab.

== Javascript
Favour jquery plugins for your development, run your js in application_layout, NEVER in templates
